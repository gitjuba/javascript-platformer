# Platforming game

A (for now extremely) minimalistic platformer written in JavaScript.

## Usage

To play, open `docs/index.html` in a browser. To develop, run `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm run dev` to start the dev-server, see console output for URL. And `npm test` to run the little test suite (not all that useful atm...).

## Gameplay goal I (done)

A half-decent basic platformer with single-screen levels with simple goals, a start and an end.

See [this GH project](https://github.com/gitjuba/javascript-platformer/projects/5).

## Gameplay goal II (in progress)

More involved levels, with more stuff to do than just reaching the goal. See [this project](https://github.com/gitjuba/javascript-platformer/projects/7).

This requires a more sophisticated level editor, see [this project](https://github.com/gitjuba/javascript-platformer/projects/4).

Also, before the game becomes too complicated, some code clean-up, refactoring and proper abstraction is in order, see [this project](https://github.com/gitjuba/javascript-platformer/projects/5).
